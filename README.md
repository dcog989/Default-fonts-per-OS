# ![logo](https://github.com/dcog989/Default-fonts-per-OS/blob/main/favicon.svg) Fonts by OS

A list of default installed fonts for each operating system, presented in an interactive HTML display.

**[Show me the fonts!](https://rawcdn.githack.com/dcog989/Default-fonts-per-OS/82066fbac0aba7c0991e21f8ba11555e032c8675/index.html)**

The page provides two views which can be changed at the top of the page: a list view with sample text, and a more compact table view.

The fonts are stored in a JSON file so it's easy to add or update as needed.

**Note: fonts not installed on your system are displayed in red monospace.**
